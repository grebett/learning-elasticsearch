# Learning Elasticsearch
While discovering a whole new tool, it's quite mandatory to follow the advised tutorials. This repository will thus contain my personal exercices based on
[Elasticsearch: the Definitive Guide](https://github.com/grebett/learning-elasticsearch.git) tutorial.

# Caveat
Consider that the mentionned tutorial has been written for Elasticsearch `v1.4`, but, at the time of writing this `README.md` file, Elasticsearch is `v2.1`. Some adjustements must then be done, even though the tutorial is supposed to follow the edge version. Installing Elasticsearch and its plugins has been changed drastically. Use the `install_*.sh` files to perform an up-to-date correct installation.
